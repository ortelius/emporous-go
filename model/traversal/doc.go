package traversal

// This package defines methods for traversing through a tree of
// model.Node types. If a node type implements the model.Iterator interface,

// The Tracker types stores node relationship information for traversal.
// It also tracker which nodes have been visited and a node budget (if set).

// Walk performs a simple iterative DFS traversal over the tree.
